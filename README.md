# UrbanFootprint Client Configuration

Each UrbanFootprint installation needs a client configuration which is specific to the geographic
region being studied. UrbanFootprint client configurations reside in their own standalone git repository
that is referenced in UrbanFootprint as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

We provide sample client configurations in the [urbanfootprint-configuration repository](https://github.com/CalthorpeAnalytics/urbanfootprint-configuration).
The recommended way to manage client configurations is to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the
[urbanfootprint-configuration](https://github.com/CalthorpeAnalytics/urbanfootprint-configuration) repo. You can
then model a new client configuration off of the existing clients.
